# BSc Degree Project

## Project Title
(Írd ide a szakdolgozatod címét – pl. "Performance and Maintainability Aspects of React Applications")

## Description
This repository contains the source code, documentation, and research materials for my BSc Degree Project.  
The project focuses on investigating **[fő téma, pl. performance optimization and maintainability in React-based applications]**.  

The aim of the project is to:
- analyze the chosen problem domain,
- implement proof-of-concept solutions or case studies,
- evaluate results with metrics, benchmarks, and/or static code analysis,
- provide recommendations and conclusions for future work.

## Structure
- `/src` – Source code (implementations, examples, experiments)
- `/docs` – Documentation, reports, thesis-related notes
- `/tests` – Automated tests and performance measurement scripts
- `README.md` – Project description (this file)

## Technologies
